ADO.NET => lower level API -> write lots of code

Dapper is micro ORM from StackOverflow (collection of extenstion methods)
Existing database
Northwind, AdventureWorks

var employees =  db.connection.execute <Employees>("select * from Employee")
var employees =  db.connection.execute <Employees>("usp_GetEmployee");

ORM => Object Relational Mapper
data access code simpler and write less amount of code

 Entity Framework -> Saves lots of time in creating/accessing the database
 1. You can create complete DB using C# code with code-first approach, concept called Migrations
 2. You can access database and CRUD operations with just C# (LINQ) without writing any SQL
    Dapper/ADO.NET => SELECT * from Jobs where salary > 60000
                    100000
    EF             => var employees = Jobs.where(e => e.Salary > 60000).ToList();
                                      SELECT * from Jobs where salary > 60000
                      var employees = Jobs.ToList().where(e => e.Salary > 60000).ToList();
                                      SELECT * from Jobs;
                                      then the filter > 60000 is gonna happen in memory
 3. Can map the data to C# Entities 
 
 
 Jobs => Jobs info  Id, Title, Desc, JobCode
 Candidate => Candidates
 Submissions => When candidates apply for the job Id, [CandidateId & JobId] => Unique constraint 
 JobStatusLookUp => Open, Closed, pending closed, postponed
  
 Step 1 : Install EF Core tools package globally
 Step 2 : First create an Entity -> C# object that represents a table in the database
 Step 3 : Install required EF Core Packages from Nuget in projects
          Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer
          Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design
 Step 4 : In EF we have 2 very important classes 
            DbContext => Represents your database 
            DbSet => Represents your tables 
 Step 5 : Create the DbContext class and DbSet properties for the project
 Step 6 : Create the Database ConnectionString, and establish that connectionString with the DbContext
            Keep ConnectionStrings if locally in the project in appsettings.json
            user secrets
            Azure KeyVault
            "RecruitingDbConnection": "Server=Abhilash-PC;Database=RecruitingDb;Integrated Security=True;"
 Step 7 : Establish that connectionString with the DbContext using DI using the AddDbContext method
 Step 8 : Create your first Migration using dotnet ef tools commands 
          dotnet ef migrations add InitialMigration -p ../Infrastructure/Infrastructure.csproj
 Step 9 : Always, check your migration file and see if it has things that you are trying to create.
 Step 10 :Apply the migration using command
           dotnet ef database update
 Step 11 : To Model your database with rules, constraints etc we cam do in two ways
            1. Data Annotations
            2. Fluent API 
            
            
  asynchorous programming -> 2002
  async/await -> 2012  older .net framework 4.5
  
  
  
  
  T1
   public async  Task< IActionResult> Index()
          {
             
             var x = 10;
             // database
             // I/O bound -> go to this URL and fetch me some data/image network, file download
             // database calls
             // theradpool
            
             // waiting 
             //  prevent Thread starvation
              var jobs = await _jobService.GetAllJobs(); -> returning task
              return View();
              // therad starvation, scalability of our application
          }

To do validations we use Dataannotations

IRepository<Candidate> -> BaseRepository<Candidate>

Middleware ->  Request  that will request will go thru series of code and they will return back in reverse order


R -> M1 (check the user is authenticated, check the http header and maybe read some http info)
     M2 (some logic)
     M3
     
 
Response
 
 Built-in Middlewares
 Custom middlewares
 Register them in proper order
 
 
 Home Page list all the Jobs -> foe each and every job you should give option (link) to see submissions for the job
 
 Click on Job Title should go to Jobs/Details -> Apply button (POST) to Submissions table
    Candidate FirstName, LastName, Email (show Job Code and Title)
    When saving the submission check if the an submission already exists for that email
 Create New Jon button on Jobs list Page 
    Create New Job should be using Validations and also should have dropdown (research) for JobStatus
    Create New Job and Save to Database
 
 
REST API

Company ABC

Apply for the Jobs ->
.NET Team Web APP using MVC C#, SQL Server Database

Create an API (REST, Http), old API Web Services SOAP

number of endpoints -> based on HTTP verbs GET, POST PUT DELETE

GET http://recruting.com/api/jobs -> List of Jobs sorted by Created date
GET http://recruting.com/api/jobs/1 -> Details of the Job
POST http://recruting.com/api/jobs -> Admin will create a new Job

POST http://recruting.com/api/submissions -> Apply for the Job by candidate
GET http://recruting.com/api/submissions/jobs/1 -> Get all the submissions for a particular Job

Provide a proper Documentation
Swagger

Mobile Team
iOS (Swift) and Android(Java) app ->
list of jobs => call the Recruiting API end point
GET http://recruting.com/api/jobs ->
 

 
 // Authenticated and also some roles -> HR, Admin,
 1. Admins can create jobs and can see the submissions 
 2. Admins can close a job
 3. Admins can schedule an interview
 4. Admins can create OnBoarding process, creating employees, editing employee details
 
 5. Employees should be able to see their info only when they log in
 6. Candidates can see only their submissions
 
 7. Interviewers can see what interviews they need to do
 
 // public information
 8. List of jobs, searching for Jobs, Job details
 
 
 We should be able to create accounts
 
 Register in to your application
 
 User -> Id, FirstName, LastName, password, email, salt, createdDate
